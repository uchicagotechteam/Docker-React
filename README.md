React Native template for projects built and running in Docker

Example react project credits: https://github.com/KarthikeyanRanasthala/react-unit-converter

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have npm installed.
Check with `node -v`

If you don't have it, download Node.js which npm is distributed through. [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you have npm, you might want to update it if it's been a while.

`npm install npm@latest -g`

## Building and Running
Run `make start` to build and run the Docker container. 

The project will run locally in `http://localhost:3001` and will compile automatically upon changes to the src code.
